This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(earlyR)
library(incidence)
```
```{r}
SEIR_Jaisalmer_model <- read.csv("~/codes/Jaisalmer-R0/SEIR_data.csv")

keeps_PC <- c("Date", "S","E","I","R","Incidence" )
SEIR_Jaisalmer_model1<- SEIR_Jaisalmer_model[keeps_PC]
head(SEIR_Jaisalmer_model1)
```
```{r}
sir_start_date <- "27-03-2020"
SEIR_Jaisalmer_model1$Date <- as.Date(SEIR_Jaisalmer_model1$Date, "%d/%m/%Y")
today <- as.Date("2020-05-06")

Infected <- as.incidence(SEIR_Jaisalmer_model1$Incidence, SEIR_Jaisalmer_model1$Date, last_date =today)
plot(Infected)
#all.equal(Infected,SEIR_Jaisalmer_model )

```
```{r}
Infected
```


```{r}
mu <- 7.5 # mean in days days
sigma <- 3.5 # standard deviation in days
```
```{r}
library(earlyR)

res <- get_R(Infected, si_mean = mu, si_sd = sigma)
res

```
```{r}
plot(res)

```
```{r}
R_val <- sample_R(res, 1000)
summary(R_val) # basic stats
```
```{r}
today <- as.Date("2020-04-28")

plot(res, "lambdas", scale = length(SEIR_Jaisalmer_model1$Date) + 1)
abline(v = SEIR_Jaisalmer_model1$Date, lwd = 0.1, col = "grey")
abline(v = today, col = "blue", lty = 2, lwd = 2)
#points(SEIR_Jaisalmer_model1$Date, seq_along(SEIR_Jaisalmer_model1$Date), pch = 10, cex = 1)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
